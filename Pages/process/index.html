    <p> As an artist transitioning from traditional mediums into the digital art world,
         my creative process is deeply rooted in my experience with alcohol ink and pencil. 
         These mediums allow me to explore fluidity and precision, giving life to the portraits and character drawings. 
         While I’ve worked with a variety of tools, I find myself most drawn to classic pencil sketches of the human form.
          <br> 
          <br>I'm often inspired by the <strong>music </strong> I’m listening to or by <strong>memories </strong>that resonate with me. Even a simple, 
          pleasant conversation can ignite my imagination and push me toward the canvas, 
          whether it’s physical or digital.

        My artistic style leans toward neotraditional, but I’m on a personal journey to carve out something uniquely mine. 
        Each piece I create is a reflection of where I am in my artistic growth—an evolving blend of what I know 
        and what I’m learning.</p>
