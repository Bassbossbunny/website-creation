<h2> Rachel Payette </h2>
<p>
    I am an artist inspired by Art Nouveau and neo-traditional 
    styles, drawing influence from artists like Danvillablanca,
     Loish, Kellogsloops, and Vitaly Morozov. 
     Working primarily with alcohol markers and ink, 
     I am now expanding into the digital art space. 
     Typically, I specialize in character drawings and portraits.
     <br> 
     I have been passionate about art since childhood, 
     always drawn to capturing people, characters, 
     and mythical creatures. 
     Heavily influenced by instrumental music and the simple magic of daily kindness from others,
      my work aims to give form to emotions and feelings,
     creating a visual representation of the human experience.
